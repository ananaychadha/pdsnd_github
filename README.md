### Project Title
Post your Work on Git Hub

### Description
Through the .csv files provided by Udacity (washington.csv, chicago.csv, new_york_city.csv) I uncovered the usage of bike sharing patterns. I compared the system usafe between three large cities:Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC

### Files used		
(Since these files were too large to be uploaded to github, I used .gitignore for these)
washington.csv
new_york_city.csv
chicago.csv

### Credits
Just focused on the Udacity content
